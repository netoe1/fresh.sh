# fresh.sh : Scripts for developers that like to corrupt linux's kernel.


**These are scripts to install packages, if you corrupt your system and have to format your computer. I did yesterday haha.**

I'm doing projects to make some libs for python, to make this more professional, but, for now, I need to fix this problem the most quickly way possible.

Enjoy!
